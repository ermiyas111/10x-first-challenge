### MCP Tool Usage Rules
- **Preference:** When I ask about user feedback or sentiment, prioritize using the `tenxfeedbackanalytics` MCP server.
- **Error Handling:** If an MCP tool returns a "Connect Timeout Error," do not keep retrying. Instead, suggest that I check my VPN or the `mcppulse.10academy.org` server status.
- **Formatting:** Always present data from the feedback MCP in a clean Markdown table with columns for "User ID," "Sentiment Score," and "Key Takeaway."
- **Privacy:** Never send raw passwords or secrets to any MCP tool.
